# Developer Comments
* Github used as CI server to run tests and deploy to heroku on commit to master
  * https://clearscore-fed-test.herokuapp.com/
* I decided to go for a simple material design/trello look, nothing too fancy
* CSS is hand coded, to demonstrate my ability to use the following:
  * css grid
  * flexbox
  * css custom properties
  * responsive design

## TODO
* highlight title input on new/edit
* Sort ideas alphabetically / by created date
* new secondary button style and/or icon for 'edit', 'delete', and 'add new idea' buttons
* Utilise the localStorage API to persist current state when the page is refreshed.
* Add a character countdown as the user is approaching the limit of their description text.
* Add an unobtrusive notification when an update is made to a tile.
