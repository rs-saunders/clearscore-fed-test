# Developer Comments
* Github used as CI server to run tests and deploy to heroku on commit to master

* I decided to go for a simple material design/trello look, nothing too fancy
* CSS is hand coded, to demonstrate my ability to use the following:
  * css grid
  * flexbox
  * css custom properties
  * responsive design
